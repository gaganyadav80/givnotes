# **Givnotes**

Where your notes meet beautiful UI. Private, secure and with the love of Open Source. 
All your data that is uploaded to the cloud is encrypted using your master key and no one except you can have access to it.

## Getting Started

Fork or clone the repository. You can also download it as zip file.

First release version will be completely free to use.
<br>Later release will maintain two repositories:

One repositry will be open source without the paid features.

The other repository will be private and will have all the features (free and paid) with *no trackers or anything suspicious*, we promise.

- This app uses Firebase for authentication and syncing todos.
